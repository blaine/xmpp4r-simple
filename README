= Synopsis

  # Send a message to a friend, asking for authorization if necessary:
  im = Jabber::Simple.new("user@example.com", "password")
  im.deliver("friend@example.com", "Hey there friend!")

  # Get received messages and print them out to the console:
  im.received_messages { |msg| puts msg.body if msg.type == :chat }

  # Send an authorization request to a user:
  im.add("friend@example.com")

  # Get presence updates from your friends, and print them out to the console:
  # (admittedly, this one needs some work)
  im.presence_updates do |update|
    from     = update[0].jid.strip.to_s
    status   = update[2].status
    presence = update[2].show
    puts "#{from} went #{presence}: #{status}"
  end

  # Remove a user from your contact list:
  im.remove("unfriendly@example.com")

  # See the Jabber::Simple documentation for more information.

= Description

Jabber::Simple is intended to make Jabber client programming dead simple. XMPP,
the Jabber protocol, is extremely powerful but also carries a steep learning
curve. This library exposes only the most common tasks, and does so in a way
that is familiar to users of traditional instant messenger clients.

= Known Issues

* None. If you'd like additional functionality, please contact the developer!
